                <p>SyntaxSprout is a web application and a tool that gives you an easy way to construct syntax trees.<br/>
                It is mainly developed for linguistic syntax trees, but feel free to explore other uses as well.</p>
                <h2 className="text-amber-400">Who made SyntaxSprout ?</h2>
                <p>SyntaxSprout is created by Heming Hanevik, a data technology graduate from the Univeristy of Bergen.</p>
                <h2 className="text-amber-400">Where are my syntax trees stored ?</h2>
                <p>When you create a new syntax tree, it is stored in your browser's local storage. <br/> 
                So you will not find trees that are created on a different device or a different browser.<br/>
                It also means that you will not find any previous created trees if you clear your browser's local storage.</p>
